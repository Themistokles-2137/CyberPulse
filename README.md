- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Visual representation of incident trends, sector distribution, and severity metrics
- **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Find specific incidents based on multiple criteria
- **Source Management**: Track and evaluate the reliability of different information sources
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Charts and graphs for data-driven decision making

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, NLTK
- **Web Scraping**: BeautifulSoup4, Trafilatura, Requests
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap, Chart.js

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/indian-cyber-incident-monitor.git
   cd indian-cyber-incident-monitor
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file with the following:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/icim
   SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key
   FLASK_DEBUG=1
   ```

5. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   # Create the database in PostgreSQL
   createdb icim  # May vary based on your PostgreSQL setup
   
   # Run database initialization script
   python init_db.py
   ```

6. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   # or
   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app
   ```

## 🧠 Machine Learning Components

### Source Classifier

The Source Classifier model evaluates and categorizes potential sources of cyber incident information. It uses:

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Transforms text into numerical features
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Classifies sources based on their relevance to Indian cybersecurity

### Incident Classifier

The Incident Classifier analyzes incident descriptions to categorize them by:

- **Sector**: Identifies affected sectors (finance, healthcare, government, etc.)
- **Severity**: Assigns criticality levels based on impact and scope
- **Attribution**: Attempts to identify threat actors when possible

## 🕸️ Web Scraping Capabilities

The system implements specialized scrapers for different types of sources:

- **News Scraper**: Collects information from cyber security news websites
- **Twitter Scraper**: Gathers data from relevant Twitter accounts and hashtags
- **Pastebin Scraper**: Monitors paste sites for data leaks and hacker communications

Each scraper implements proper rate limiting, content filtering, and data normalization to ensure quality and compliance.

## 📊 Visualization Features

The dashboard presents actionable intelligence through several visualizations:

- **Incident Trend**: Time-based graph of incident frequency
- **Sector Distribution**: Breakdown of incidents by affected sector
- **Severity Distribution**: Incidents categorized by severity level
- **Source Reliability**: Evaluation of information sources

## 🔄 API Documentation

The system provides a RESTful API for integration with other security tools:

### GET /api/incidents
Retrieve a list of incidents with optional filtering.

**Parameters:**
- `page`: Page number (default: 1)
- `per_page`: Results per page (default: 10)
- `sector`: Filter by sector
